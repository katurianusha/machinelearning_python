"I almost can't play any video on this stream app, every time i have android error 4003 even after this new update of 17th February",
محتاجة اعرف موجود عليه مسلسل Küçük sırlar ولا لا ؟,
The app needs to have a quality control panel like the web version as I can't adjust the Quality which sometimes consume a lot of data Plus the app doesn't allow you to do anything else while watching as it doesn't have a picture in picture feature,
App getting freeze please check and clear the issues ASAP,
Is very bad,
Nice,
"App doesn't open, stays on loading screen for ages",
"The application uses much data, unlike other applications, you cannot adjust streaming quality, hope to see this improvement Thank you for your kind response",

This is not easy to use at all 😡,
My account not working After the update,
🗑️🗑️🚮🚮,
🤮🤮,
Useless app,
"The app is good enough, the only feature the app lacks is to handle the play/pause button on Android TV. We have to click the Ok button twice to achieve the same.",
Horrible experience 🥺 we can't watch any thing because the error 4003!! all this movies and shows and can't play it even 1 minute!!! The worst app ever!! Netflix can't do this to us never!!!,
"Good app when it works. Most of the time, I can't login a lot of times due to some kind of buggy geoblocking which prevents me from accessing the content I paid for.",

اوك المحتوى اللي داخل التطبيق ممتاز .و لكن التطبيق نفسه جدا فاشل و مبدئي أتمنى تغيروه من الصفر,
Osn+ is a great app and I've been using osn for a long time,
Not working & not starting,
"I have not been able to use this app on my Android phone or my Android TV for 2 months now. ""Player Error Default Android TV (2004)"" I contacted customer service many times and didn't hear back from them. It's almost like their service in none existence. I paid for a full year and I can count on one hand how many times this app worked. Makes me very unhappy to not get what I paid for.",
👍🏻,
يعرض مسلسلات قبيحه وشذوذ صريح,
I already subscribe but I can not open the app. 😔😔,
I was incorrectly charged. Terrible customer service I've been chatting with them for days without going anywhere,
Horrible. Just the definition of HORRIBLE.,
quality adjust is required 😏😌,
"Worst app ever, Don't use it, always forced to steal money from bank the subscription system is a scam and they take more money than the payment of the subscription",
"Streaming is good, but when it comes to downloaded content problems exist like not being able to change the download quality and the help section is no good.",
Lagging and the video is blurry And the subscription price is high for a low quality videos,
This app always has an error with android Every time after watching it I should restart my mobile to open app again,
Nice,
Please bring OSN to PlayStation consoles,
"This is the worst streaming service I have used till date. The subscription cost is exorbant considering they don't provide 4k, HDR or dolby atmos content. Even the HD content streamed is of a very low bitrate inspite of which the video buffers even on high speed internet. The mobile app and TV apps UI are bad too. Hopefully hbo max will launch independently in the middle east instead of piggybacking on such a poor platform. I also faced issues where the episode skips to the next before it ends.",
i hate this app,
The bestt app ever,
Not able to open the app... it is stick on the landing screen (OSN+ logo),
Worst app,
On the television it's always going to the login app even after putting in the right details. Some bug is present. Samsung QLED tv.,
The best series but the app needs improvement.,
"Recently, the app logged out from my tv, samsung (QN90BA), and when I try to log in , it logs out immediately. I cleared the data and cash, then deleted the app and re installed it, but the same issue persisted",

One of the worst apps ever. It would not launch most of the time,
Bad,
"Why have a custom keyboard for Samsung TV, It's a nightmare. alphabet organized! Really!",

احذروا منهم شركة تلتصق فيك الى الأبد مثل السرطان والعياذ بالله، مجرد يعرفون رقمك وحسابك البنكي مستحيل يتركونك في حالك يسجلوك اشتراك غصب وحتى بعد ما تموت راح يستمر الاشتراك غصب عن اهلك. الطريقة الوحيدة للتخلص منهم انك تلغي حسابك البنكي وتكسر بطاقتك,
"Good collection but very poor app and player. Some series skip the episode before it ends without warning, and the player stutters when adjusting the quality with no option to set a preferred quality. Not to mention unresponsive or smug customer support.",
