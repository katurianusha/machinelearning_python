No option of subtitles in sony and others,
Shark tank episode are not getting updated on the app after 25,

Why will it not take my quality preference???,
Jio TV is best app for all live channel free,
Good,
Jio provide free tv but you just want a recharge. When we recharge in Airtel we are unable to access tv channels via xstream. While as in jio itz free even after and before recharge. If u run out of data and recharge jio tv run smoothly. Kindly update ur system otherwise we have to switch to jio.,

"Takes more than 2 days to upload tv shows from the air time Very disgusting app. Update - WWE shows get uploaded the next day whereas 3 - 4 months earlier, it used to get uploaded within 3 hours of air time which is causing unimaginable embarrassment and anger to me. With these things, a 1 star is also too much as I dont have an option of 0 star",

"Using this app is like using an illegal website or App which doesn't show contents properly. Following are the problems I faced while using this app. 1. Low quality of the contents even on 5G where speed is atleast 10mbps. 2. No timely updation of daily TV SHOWS e.g., SHARK TANK INDIA 2 episodes are not updated after episode No 20. 3. No download option in all the contents. 4. Many more if use it further.",
Amszing app,
Very nice app 👍,
Worth the money.,
Very nice and helpful to have my phone with,
Episodes of Shark tank India will come only after 24 hours after releasing in sonyliv. After 24 hours anyone can watch on sonyliv for free.. what is the point of paying xstream?,
Best,
Not worth it,
Excellent,

Why there is no t showing new episodes after 20 on Shark tank india and master chef india 😤,

"Worst app. latest episodes are not uploaded timely in xstream app. Many times contacted through email. They don't have any solution. I paid for one year, Suggestion to others buy only original ott subscription instead airtel Xstream app.",
Why the shows aren't updating on the app?? Saturday's shows are last updated,
I have the Airtel Xtreme fiber (999/month pack) but they are still asking to buy it.,
Good,
Best app,
Many shows episode is not available like Shark tank india,
"Some of the episodes is not available, on the other hand its a good aap",
Best experience and also dada consume also best thanku so much Airtel xstream app,
sonyliv episodes again stops coming. Since 2 days it's not being available in Xtreme app. Really not worth to have premium subscription.,
New episodes of shows especially from Sony liv are not available almost after 72hrs of telecasting.,
Good content,

Application is god
