This App is ok but the last update makes episodes or programs pause while playing. You press play and the App pauses again. You have to continue pressing play to get to the end of the episode or program you are watching. It's very annoying. This was not an issue before the update. It's a serious bug in the update and needs fixing. Will give more stars when it is fixed. Please give thought to fixing this annoying issue as soon as possible. Thank You.,

"Terrible, doesn't worth the price! btw if you want to cancel you need to call a number!! I'm not kidding.",
gg,
the app stoped working on my device and the support keep thanking on feedback with no action.,
"It is hard to unsubscribe! You will find a small link for that, that will then ask you to call a number! So weird for an application that have been around for a while now.",
It is very bad from such a reputable company to have an app where users cannot stop their subscription or pur it on hold...I wish I never downloaded the app in the first place. This is a scam.,
amazing,
"Once you subscribe, you can never unsubscribe again. You can never reach them no matter what. They charge you automatically without your consent and there is no help available or any customer service. Do NOT get a subscription with them. It's not worth it.",
التطبيق مفيهوش مسلسل جعفر العمده وحطيت في الصوره أن موجود,
هاتفي galaxy a31 عندما اشاهد اي عرض هناك تقطيع وبطيء علما اني استخدم تطبيقات اخرى بدون هذه المشكله,
I wonder why I can not cancel my subscription ? It s a scam,
رائع جدا والله,
I love the app,
اعاني من مشاكل كثيره بالبرنامج اليوم الاول لرمضان انزل الحلقه لاشاهدها بدون انترنت و تختفي وقت التشغيل ليظهر اشعار بانه انتهت الصلاحيه !! في السابق حصل اكثر من مره ان يفصل احد الاجهزه تلقائيا!! عند المشاهده من عدة اجهزه نظام تتابع الحلقات لا يعمل و من الصعب ان اختار الحلقه المعنيه في حال هناك مسلسلات طويله !! يرجى النظر في حل المشاكل,
So. Nice,
Nice good best very nice thanks app,

I had a problem signing in to my account. I reached out to their customers service. I explained the issue and send all my account details. But guess what no one got back to me!! It's been almost a week now still no answer! I don't recommend this app. It's literally scam they just want to steal your money. Update. I sent another email to follow up on my logging in problem. Let's see if someone cares!! Marwa Khalid is The agent who sent me one email and then disappeared. So unprofessional.,
Not open please help me......there is a problem on it..not open just a black page,

To cancel the subscription you need to call saudi arabia phone number,

Very bad,
المبرمج يلي عامل شاهد لا يفقه شيئ بالبرمجة لا يوجد تطبيق أولاً يطلب تحديث إجباري كل فترة قصيرة تطبيق نيتفليكس ويوتيوب موجود على جوالي من سنتين ولم أقم بتحديثه هذا استفزازاز وغلط مبرمج ثانياً من غير المنطق ان ادفع اشتراك وسيرفر شاهد جداً بطيئ لدرجة اني تابعت نفس المسلسل على منصة مجانية دون اي تقطيع قررت اليوم ان الغي اشتراك شاهد بسبب طلب تحديث التطبيق الإجباري,
أسوأ تطبيق استخدمته في حياتي،، دايما يعلق و سبب لي مشاكل للتلفون،، انا نادم جدا إنه اشتركت معاهم. وبعد سنتين لازالت خدمة العملاء في تطبيق شاهد هي الأسوأ على الاطلاق.,
را,
Great application.,
What's going on with the apps can't open 😕 downloading since an hour,
دفعت الاشتراك و لكن حسابي لا يعمل ..اكثر من اسبوع اشتكي و لكن بلا جدوي او اهتمام !!!,

Good enough,
It has the best shows anyone could ask for,
I love it 😀,
It's good. And it also translate Indian series into Arabic so that's why I like it very much,
"The worst app I have ever used in my life... I am trying to watch 1 particular show that is less than 40 minutes (without intro and outro) and I get 4 ads interrupting the scenes every 5 minutes, and when they are over the app takes me to the next episode every single time... Horrible experience, I'm not gonna watch anything on shahid again",
The best app that you can with watch the arabian drama or series,
جيد,

"Stopped operating on my Android setup box few updates , I get a message saying that my box H96 max with android 11, which runs google play store , YouTube native app , Netflix, doesn't meet the Shahid's security requirements! And I am asked to use either Xiaomi box or Amazon fire or Chromecast! I paid a full subscription amount , and now because of an internal Shahid app update I am locked out from enjoying watching on my tv screen! Monopoly?",
احسن تطبيق عندي الصراحة كل الدعم لكم وبالتوفيق👏🏻❤❤❤,

بعد التحديث الاخير يوم 11/3/2023 البرنامج لا يعمل على الهواتف او التلفزيون و الشكوى لم تحل، الدعم الفني فقط يعلم قول كلمة اعادة تشغيل و ينقلون المشكلة من شخص لاخر، لا يوجد فنييون اكفاء لحل المشكلة,

Stay Away: Scam أسوأ خدمة عملاء تعاملت معها على الاطلاق. ولا توجد طريقة للتصعيد مع الإدارة بأى طريقة ولا لإلغاء الاشتراك. توقف حسابى وجاءت رسالة بعمل اشتراك جديد، بالفعل اشتركت مجددا بإيميل مختلف، ولم انتبه انهم يسحبون الاشتراك الشهري من كلا الحسابين وخدمة العملاء تقول لا refund ل3 اشهر من دفع الاشترك double ثم فوجئت بالامس توقف الحساب مرة اخرى، وخدمة العملاء تطلب فتح حساب جديد بسعر اشتراك اعلى، ورفضوا حتى ان يجددوا الاشتراك بسعرى السابق، منتهى التعامل بعنجهية و عناد ولا يفرق معهم ان الخطأ منهم.,
المفروض يكون مجاني بعد تحميل التطبيق و نتحمل فترات الاعلان.. مو الاثنين سوه هم اشتراك و هم اعلانات,
There is too much ads,
اسوء منصة بعد الاشتراك لايوجد اي خدمة وعند إعادة تثبيت البرنامج مره اخرى يظهر عدم الاشتراك ويطلب إعادة الاشتراك,
Can't re-subscribe. No customer service. The whole thing is a mess and complicated,
Exclusive streaming in arab world,
Absolut lousy service.,
Very bad,
Worst experience ever....if you want to cancel subscription you have to call the customer service number which they will no reply and at the end you had to cancel your card to cancel subscription.,
التطبيق بعلق كتير بكون بحضر في مسلسل وفجأة بتوقف الحلقه ألي كنت بحضر فيها وبشتغل صوت ما أله علاقة في الحلقة ألي كنت أحضرها,
Very bad customer service if you need help they will only send you what is already in their website.,
A failed application that deals with the Zionist occupation,
Scam,
The worst streaming app i have ever seen full of bugs,

Can't log to my account,
التطبيق لا يعمل بعد آخر تحديث رغم دفع الاشتراك حيث أن التحديث أصبح غير متوافق مع جهاز ى و الآن ما مصير الاشتراك المدفوع ؟ لا توجد اجابه,
Worst updates,
Bad,
The app keeping logout from the account and turn of with no reason even after uninstall and reinstall,
Bad,
Worst app I have ever seen,
Stop Subscribe shahid.,
"Its a scam, do no not subscribe.",
"I can't open the app in any other android devices?!! I have a VIP membership and still can't do that. Before it was okay now am getting this stupid msg."" It seems that this device doesn't follow shahid's security requirements. You can enjoy watching shahid content from any other device connected to your account."" It makes no sense all my devices are connected to my account still not working 🤷‍♀️",
This is by far the worst app i've ever used i made transactions twice but it never gave me my subscription. Money was transfered and i got a notification but it didnt let me watch paying shows even though i got the premium offer. DONT USE THIS APP.,
Very bad ❌️❗️سيء جدا,
"Bad costumer service and difficult to reach to them، am not able to reach to subscription,",
تطبيق سئ جدا ولا انصح احد باستعماله,

Very heavy application even if oyu have high speed Internet it will keep pausing,
"The application doesn't perform well on smart TV. Slow, unresponsive and hard to use overall.",
Initially I was not convinced to download it... But with time I see a lot of interested programs in ads. So I started to see in Chrome.. But the app is much better and easy to use,
"Good content, but you really need to work on your server. Tv shows are not loading the app crash and shows black screen.",
"I hate how it have legit EVERYTHING in premium, and I have to pay 😡",
So many ads,
"This app doesn't have negative rating for me to give rating, their support is ridiculous and they are no help, I have many customers who were using this app and now can't use it anymore because of the restricting all Android boxes to use their app. What a joke. Please everyone don't subscribe to this service as their is many alternatives.",
Very nice,
"I cant unsubscribe like before, now i got message call a number to unsub, why making things complicated!!?",

"It's a tricky website, if you want cancel they won't let you do that , they give you a phone number to call for cancelation but it not going work ,tried the website to see a turkish movie , nothing special about this app ,total disappointment.",

بكفي يا MbC نشر زنا بكفي نشر زنا خلي أزمة منتصف ينفعكم,
The worst app. Slow not working .I have a supscription here but I watch series from other websites !.,
Great 😃,
"It was useful when there was one month subscription, when you have a week break you can watch Shahid, but with minimum 3 months subscription it useless, your content is everywhere I won't pay 3 months to watch a series or a movie. UNINSTALL Plus the HUGE amount of notifications",
Difficult to register,
"It is literally impossible for me to unsubscribe after increasing the price to 299aed, this is not acceptable",
You did an updates the App start cant mirror to chrome cast because of auto sizing. you did the worst for the App . Another problem the sound suddenly gone .guys try to work in serious way with subscribers.,
It's nice and amazing there is no ads,
"التحديث الأخير مش بيفتح على الأندرويد خالص,, إزاي تقبلوا الاشتراكات وانتوا عندكم مشكله في الابليكيشن أصلا!!!",
"Takes lots of time for loading, really slow",
FayazSoomro Rev,
Awesome app,
I gotta say I really appreciate Shahid for a lot of reasons : one of the best things about the app is most of their shows have English subtitles so its makes it easier to watch shows with family! Plus the app doesn't ever crash or have any issues !,
"I cannot use my Account and subscribe button keeps appearing athough I paid 8 days ago and I have to wait for 48 hours till the issue get Fixed, why I should wait athough the app didn't wait for me till I reactivate my monthly bundle?",
good,
"I CAN'T CANCEL! This is a scam. I literally can't cancel my subscription and they won't let me!!!! I have sent emails and contacted them on multiple platforms and they ignore messages and emails when it concerns canceling subscriptions. They answer messages when it's about website issues but don't bother when it's to cancel. I tried on the Browser and on the App. Both won't let me cancel. How is this allowed? We have a right to cancel ""anytime"" yet can't get access to the cancelation protocol?!",
Awful application .. always drops down they are not covering the users .. just collecting money,
I had a very bad experience because I paid twice and I couldn't subscribe,
لا يعمل التطبيق في التفاز بعد التحديث الاخير يرجى حل هذه المشكلة,
سئ!!!!!!!!!!,
من ادخل للموقع يكتبلي (يبدو أن هذا الجهاز لا يتبع متطلبات الأمان الخاصة بشاهد. يمكنك الاستمتاع بمشاهدة محتوى شاهد من أي جهاز ممكن اعرف شنو الخلل؟ (آخر متصل بحسابك,
its a very bad experience you won't find a way to unsubscribe,
Doesn't work anymore on my Android TV box and on my phone because of my custom ROM. And yes I pay for the subscription 😓,

I have a slingtv account with a subscription that includes shahid. First week shahid was working well on slingtv then it was not showing any movies or any available material on shahid. I had to use my slingtv account on shahid website to continue watching. Most of the time episodes are not available or simply not loading. Now I can't even find the tab to login through a partner account (slingtv) available after the last update for the shahid app. Waste of money!!,
تم تسجيل الخروج من جميع الاجهزة بدون سبب الرجاء حل المشكلة في اسرع وقت,

"You can't cancel your subscription, they will force you to call them yo do that and they won't reply. You can't delete your card info from the app.",
I got the subscription the app Keeps glitching!,
1. No history for the viewed/watched videos 2. How can I jump to a specific episode? Thanks in advance. Good luck.,
Keep skipping the sence. Issue on app and in TV as well. Can't watch..better to download episodes from other site and watch,

Dont work inmy tv box,
"Totally felt scammed. Subscribed for 1 year, and it automatically renewed for the second year without prior approval or warning or reminder. I did contact shahid immediately, and they said they can not help. They only revealed the extra steps to avoid this from repeating but didn't agree to refund me.",
What can I do with this problem ( your device has been deleted from account devices please login again) it's appears on my TV !!!! on mobile working normaly but this issue Appears on TV Screen,

Device stopped working after update claiming it is not compatible with Android TV. Very bad customer service. They asked me to buy more expensive devices. Also all replies on Googlel Play are the same message copy paste.,
هلا د,
"Agora tem limite de 20 usuários, muito ruim.",

Stupid devs have blocked the app on rooted devices. That's why we get that the devices doesn't meet the system requirements.. but there's a way around it ;) .. take that stupid devs,

WHERE IS AL NASSR vs Al Wehda or ALNASSR vs al fateh or Al Nassr vs Al ittihad???? The only reason I subscribed. This is a scam. Get your act together. Put all Al Nassr games immediately.,
"Please don't subscribe! They offered 3 months for around 4 USD, I subscribed using 2 accounts. After 3 months they begin to automatically withdraw 16 USD for each account each month from credit card. I am unable to deactivate my subscription and they are requesting from me to call a Saudi number. I am a senior developer and I am sure that this can be done but this app is designed to make it difficult to deactivate account which is illegal.",
the only app that wont open on both my tvs.,

"very bad app i have subscribed bundle for one year VIP for watching the contents on tv smart screen then after less than one month it is no longer working on tv and i have tried several times to reach their customer service on WhatsApp, Facebook, app settings with no answer yet.",
يستحق نجمتان . فيه بعض العيوب ومن أهمها العدد المحدود والضئيل جدا من الافلام والمسلسلات وخصوصا الأجنبيه منها، مما يجعلك تمل من كل المحتوى تقريبا خلال اشهر بسيطه قد لا تتجاوز الثلاث او اربعه أشهر . هذا هو العيب المدمر في هذا التطبيق.,
حلو اوي,
App didn't work fine on lg tv ever 5 minutes close suddenly,
Iwas watching shahid on my android tv till 2 days ago. Suddenly everything changed. I cant watch vip inspite of iam subscribe to vip package.,

"i send email to customer care ,please help as I need to upgrade and renew subscription but no response",
App not working ( the device specification do not meet the requirements ) and my phone is new and all streaming platforms working just fine except Shahid app. And I talk to the support and he said Im using custom ROM ineed to reset to the default for app works imagine that I told him all platforms working for me just fine and he still says same thing like a robot I don't like it at all. Fix the app 😐,

ما ينفذون مطالب جمهور زد رصيدك في نزول البث كامل و مقاطع من البث على شاهد واذا ما يقدرون يعطون الصلاحيات لقناة بداية يوتيوب لأننا تعبنا و ابسط حقوقنا و ابسط حقوق المتسابقين,
"It's the worst service/app I ever subscribed to. I subscribed at first to phone only plan to try it which was a failure, then I updated to VIP plan hoping it might be better but to no avail and again a total failure. Now I have been trying to get a refund since it's been bad service but they kept going ne the runaround. My advise is to keep away from such bad provider. This is bad app and very bad customer service and I wish I could give them ZERO star.",
مش بيشتغل اصلاً,
التطبيق كل شوية يقطع بقاله كام شهر و كلمناكم و قولتم العيب من النت بس للأسف مافيش غير التطبيق بتاعكم هو إللي بيقطع للأسف تجربة سيئة جدا,

ممتاز,
"When i watch the channels ads appear even though i'm subbed to no ads tier from the start, this is scamming!",

Does not work on most TV and TV box with android 10 and older. Also not having widget to show content. I have smart tv android 9 and app not working. Also I have TV box android 10 and app not working. I need to switch on my laptop and connect it to TV to show that very bad service.,
The most genius SW developers in the whole world! They simply changing operating system and hardware requirements from one version to the next one with no prior notice and no rollback option leaving thousands of Android Box customers simply with service outage!!! Prize of stupidest app up(down)grade ever! And congratulations for the Google Play rate slide from 4.5 to 3.4 in just couple of weeks! Another negative world record .. keep going guys!,
cool,
Good,
ممتع,
Minimum requirement ? What a joke,
"Shahid is supposed to have WWE network. Could not find the Royal Rumble 2023 replay. I started my subscription today in good faith, but am now canceling my subscription also today for dissatisfaction.",
"Too Bad! When installing it on any android device i saw an error; that this: the device specifications does not meet the requirements,, its so bad",
"A problem appeared recently. When streaming to TV, the foreword and backward disappear. I can only stop the play but cannot move forward or backward. Before the app was excellent. Please fix it as soon as possible Thanks",

Not working on android tv bbox,
مشكورين على جهودكم,
وايد صاير يعلق بعد اخر تحديث مو طبيعي الوضع الحلقات ماتشتغل كله معلق,
Best app,
خدمة الغاء الاشتراك سيئة وصعبة لن اعود الاشتراك معكم مرة أخري أن شاء الله,
"It is a very stupid application and perhaps the worst ever, because the recent updates you did made many devices incompatible with the application, although other apps are working properly like Netflix, watch it, YouTube and others",
التطبيق صار غير متوافق مع جهازي بدون اي سبب تحديث فاشل وتقنين التطبيق فاشلين ويجب تغييرهم يعني نشترك بفلوس وتجبرونا نتفرج على المتصفح,
"I love this app but the payment method is what I don't like, if you can put other payment method would have been nice",
Waw,
"say the device specifications doesn't meet the requirements my phone is oneplus 6 running android 11 , Netflix is running perfectly .",
Why should I have to call to cancel my subscription!!!?????,
Terriple,
"Stop copy pasting who to contact; it makes your rating even worse. So it is a weekend, and no hope for the app to work :) The app chooses when to automatically skip intro, and the next episode button comes at different times on different series, as well as the automatic ""next episode"". Don't you think it's about time to copy and paste the codes on all series to get this over with? The app on android is still very bad.",
How come iam not able to open now at my device,
"Came here to watch Ronaldo's match, but nothing is free here and i can't bear this creepy app anymore, I'll watch highlights on YouTube, i came for Ronaldo otherwise i wouldn't search such app in my entire life",

ليه شاهد بيعمل ايموجي,
Very bad not working for many days,
🤍🤍,
Very good,
Unfortunatly it stopped working after the update 😣,
الشركة غير ملتزمة ، وتعاملهم غير محترف ، وتقوم بالغاء الإشتراكات القديمة لإجبار العملاء علي الإشتراك بالقيم الجديدة للباقات ، تجربة سيئة في مجملها,
كلما قاموا بتحديث التطبيق كلما ازداد سوء للأسف .. يجب أن يكون أسرع أداءً وأكثر مرونة .. شوفو نت فليكس كيف قوي الأداء,
Nic,
Vip لايعمل بدها عندي اشتراك سنة على فاضي,
تطبيق سيء يقطع عالبث المباشر و فجأة يقلك مافيه نت,
Itt was working on my android box and sudddenly stoppee working and error msg come tto say thee deviiice is not supported although m ddevice is version 11 android,
اكتر برنامج سيئ شوفتو دائما اعلانات كتير كل ما اتفرج خمس ثوانى الاقى اربع اعلانات دا برنامج سيئ جداا بجدد,
"It's unprofessional and a scam to suddenly change App requirements from one version to the next!! I've been paying for your service since years and using the App on my android tv box without any problem until out of nowhere we are surprised with such genius decision. Now I have a 1 year paid subscription and I'm not able to get the service I paid for. Thank you Shahid, the WORST service ever!",
تطبيق سيء جدا ولا يعطي نقاط بعد تنفيذ العروض,
الاعلانات مستفزة انا مقدرة انها خدمة بفلوس ولو مجانا اشوف اعلانات بس انا مش مجبرة اشوف تفس الاعلان ١٠٠ مرة حرفيا في اليوم دي دعاية سيئة وخلتوني كرهت الماركات الي بتعلنوا عنها ومستحيل استخدمها ولا اشتري منهم وسياسة اعلانات غبية تكرار ٤ اعلانات ورا بعض ٥ مرات في كل حلقة مين فهمكم ان دا ميضايقش المشاهد وانه ممكن يشتري حاجة وانا بقول للمعلنين ان يبطلوا يعلنوا معاكو لان اسبان الاعلانات بالشكل دا كرهني في الماركة,
Make different subscription plans for India. No one's going to pay 9USD for subscription. Most people would go the pirate route instead if it's not reasonably priced for each region.,
Why there are no english subtitles for most of the movies ?,
I needed to watch al nasser match but you are willing to pay you 13$ and it's expensive what an waste app,
Perfect application,
downloaded because of Ronaldo,
JOY AWARD,
"Subscription and etc,, is ok, but charging Almost 10 thousand indian rupees currency just for 1 year is too harsh and reckless, Not only me, many fans from around the world about to subscribe atleast for 1 month just to watch saudi pro league regarding Christiano ronaldo, but 1 month subscription charge is also morethan 800 INR, there are many websites like epicsports, yallah shoot, footbite etc,, many, (You guys also charge it, no worries) but charging morethan netlflix is pathetic, Worst Srvc",
The last update stops live stream service,
No no,
great app,
All time we have sound but the screen black 😶😶😶😶😶,
The app keeps logging me out And keeps giving me wrong password and suspicious activity It's day one and am already sick of it Watching ur shows via illegal sources is easier than paying to watch it on ur app,
Good,
Very nice,
good,
Saudi Pro league can be seen? im a CR7 fan 🙏 how to watch my goat 🐐 ronaldo 🥀,
Good,
Can we watch SAUDI pro League?!? Cristiano Ronaldo fan🤣🤣..,
Isn't working in my device,
Contains racist and false serials,
"I don't know what the kind of cheating is going on, shahid don't respect the costumers when they changed them policy to get more money on account of it's customer through the deal with some of famous brands to support its device with neglecting the extra cost it will be loaded to shahid costumers.??!!",
Thanks for the new update. I would also appreciate it if we can check for the episodes during watching one. I want to be able to go through episodes while watching an episode. I don't want to have to go back and open the series then choose the desired episode. Hope you understood me,
Expensive,
It's good but it has many adds,
واااو ده أفضل برنامج عربي,
التحديث الاخير سيء جداااا الابلكيشن توقف عن العمل على ال tv box بعد التحديث الاخير المفروض الابديت يحل مشاكل مش يعمل مشاكل وتم الغاء الاشتراك بنجاح,
Not working on tv after last update,
"After update to 7.28 i got ""your device is not compatible"" message",
Excellent,
No pin code for each profile,
"i have the same problem and you do not need to call the costumer service, because it is very clear that shahid does not respect its costumers (like netflix and amazon prime ) as its sold them to monopolistic companies (like apple and xiaomi) so that we could to buy their devices with very cheap decision",
No comment,
"تحديث""تم التواصل مع خدمة العملاء وأخبروني أنه (لايمكن ان يشتغل البرنامج الا مع اربعة شركات) بإختصار تشتري اجهزة هذه الشركات عشان تشوف شاهد.. استغلال بكل معنى الكلمة"" نفس المشكله الكثير يعانوا منها من آخر تحديث حيث توقف العمل على التلفيزيون ولا استطيع المشاهدة... اذا استمرت المشكله بدون حل سألغي اشتراكي حيث لا فائدة منه ان لم استطيع المشاهدة على التلفيزيون",

Very good,
"Hey, look, this program is really bad. It's also my first because... I need money, and it's also very slow, really, and very boring. Thank you, but you have developed a little bit of it, bye 👋🏻",
Steeling money for one month subscription from people who want to watch sports package (only reason to subscribe) after Shahid promoting and then people will be surprised that the sports package is not available in there countries. So after calling customer service line will be hanged up. Good job steeling Shahid 👏🏻👏🏻 Please tell people the sports package is not available in there countries or don't promote it. And return the money to the people who subscribed for this fake promoting.,
"already have the ultimate subscription. and now ask me to change it, because they added the sport package! i supposed i should have it for free and any future add-ons!!! .. BECAUSE I ALREADY PAID!!!! yet again, the stupid app won't process my payment and declines my cards for no reason! even when i submitted to the rip off! fix your freaking app! ** REVIEW UPDATE! been going back and forth with their so called ""care service"" tossed around like a ball! and the problem still not fixed! SHAMEFULL!",
good,
the new update caused shahid to stop working on all our android devices. please fix! your forced us to upgrade to a broken version!,
Rrr,
التطبيق مصيدة لترقية الاشتراك و سحب النقود .. عند استعراض الاشتراكات المتاحة لمعرفة الخطط يتم الترقية مباشرة و دون تأكيد من التطبيق او من البنك برسالة و بالرجوع لخدمة العملاء لالغاء الترقية الخاطئة و الرجوع للخطة السابقة يفيد بانه تم من جانبك و لا يمكن ارجاع المبالغ المسحوبة كأنها دخلت خزانة الدولة مثلا .. لا يوجد تفهم و لا مراعاة لعميل من ٥ سنوات و يستخدموا ذريعة تم من جانبك مع ان العيب فى التطبيق البدائى الخاص بهم,
Fair,
Who are here to watch cristiano Ronaldo,

After more than 3 yrs by using my machine the my machine not compatible with Shahid and I have more than 6 months in account,
"App stop working on my TV after force update, and the technical support not reply to email 😡😡😡😡.",
"I am facing the same issue some customers are facing. As an app developer you are not supposed to change the application requirements from one version to the next. Customers have paid for your service knowing that the application works om their devices and it should remain that way. This is very disappointing and rather unprofessional. For all new users, this app does not work on android TV boxes running normal Android. It only runs on Android ""TV"" version and smart TVs.",
اشيي بخزييي 💖💖🙂,
"It was working fine until last update, they decided to not support some devices, I was watching from this device for a whole year and when I contacted their customer service, the agent lied about it and told me that this device is not supported on shahid yet and tried to convince me to buy another brand of this device, sounds like they are partnering with this brand and trying to convince people buying it, and then he stopped responding when I told him I had been using it for a year!! Shame",
ماشاء الله ربي يحفظك,
Very good,

After using it on the same device for more than 3 year with no issues….And when I contacted the customer care, the simple response is that my device isn't compatable. And the care service doesn’t help….😡😡😡",
Anek vlo,
What a shame that you collect money and you don't activate the account....,
Good,
Hi Dears The last update stopped working on my device You mentioned that the minimum requirement is Android 5 and above My device is Android 7 and now it is now working Please fix,
The last update blocked our device from running the app. It requests new device since my device is outdated as they claimed,
"your last updates made my device stopped working ""doesn't meet the minimum requirements""",
انا عندي smart TV box وعندي اشتراك اصلى سنه وكان ما عنديش مشاكل ولكن بعد الاصدار الاخير اصبح يعطي رساله ان تفيد انه لا يستطيع العمل على هذا الجهاز,
"After the last update of shahid on 4 TV boxes, it is not working but returning the message ""This device specifications do not meet the requirements of the application""... Don't know what to do",
عذاب إذا تبي تلغي اشتراك,
Excellent,

"Paid for subscription, but it keeps showing otherwise. It looks like a scam",
Without any notification Shahid stop working on my tvbox running android 10. It stopped after updating the app to version higher than 7.24. After contacting customer care they said your device isn't supported without any resolution.,
مبقاش يشتغل بعد اخر تحديث وبيقل غير متوافق مع الجهاز كده مرة واحدة، مع ان النسخه اللي قبليها شغاله عادي سبحان الله!!!!!!,
"I can not watch shahid anymore on my tv box,the application is not runnig any more",
"The application was hardly working on my tv box until some genius decided to update it, making it worthless. Now it's notifying me that my newly purchased android 10 tv box specification do not meet the requirements to use it, knowing that netflix, amazon prime work fine woth their latest updates. Guys, bring professionals on board or you may lose all your subscribers. Update, the customer care ignored me repeatedly and when answered yet suggested to change all my audio-visual appliances. Shame",
ZOZO(2020),
NO LAEKT,
"Very BAD👎. PLEASE GUYS DO NOT UPDATE. If you update Shahid app you will not be able to continue watching on the android box or similar devices anymore!! As usual, They remove the supports of some devices every while with no reasons!",
The new update is not working on TV box,
gigty,
"Verry good when it was working, now it displays my box is not compatible any more. Due to latest upgrade cant watch any more. Can you please update with a fix.",
Great,
Very bad update. Now it is not working any more... Idiot....,
They won't let you cancel your subscription. An actual scam.,
It stopped working after the last update on my box ... it says the device specification don't meet the requirements to use Shahid,
"Can someone please explain why every time you update the app, a new problem shows up? Do you guys not go through QA testing before your launch to live/production? Now there is a google recaptcha issue......unreal!!!!!******UPDATE ******I emailed customer care and they resolved the issue within a day of my email and replied to me. Rating would be at 5 stars but the app forces me to log back in too many times.....otherwise I love it!",
"Very bad company, if you ever think to cancel your subscription, you have to contact the customer service and they will ask your credit card details to make the cancelation, so basically they ask you to reveal information that should be kept private",
stopped after last update .. give me my money back FU,
The latest update is not working with my android tv box. İt worked before update the app How we can solve it,

Very bad you can't cancel the subscription easily,
"the latest updates doesnt work on Android 8 or 9, most of Android TV's and Android Boxes is still with old versions, you need to re check it with your developers !!!!",
Shahid stopped working on my device after the update.,
App crashed after last update on android TV and it said “ur tv does not meet shahid requirements “ it was working fine before,
The new uptodate doesn't have thr turkish language.as audio?? Any help for the turkish series,
The app was working on idea android smart tv after the new update its not working anymore and the response of shahid was its not supported on your tv noting that it was working fine before the update that's a shame as a response,
The app isn't working after the last update!! Customer service is a waste of time!,
shahid (mbc) are forcing us to dump our android tv boxes and buy xiaomi box. i would rather cancel my subscription than do that,

Lack of accuracy, efficiency and transparency",
The download and watch offline is not working - still need to be connected to the internet!,
Stopped working after the update today and my subscription is still running. Need utgent support to fix.,
"The app was working very well on my Android box, but it suddenly stopped working after the last update. It says ""Your device specifications doesn't meet the requirements for shahid"". From reading the recent reviews, it's clear that their is an issue with the recent update that has to be fixed. If this was a planed change to your Shahid app, then a proper message should have been sent to your customers ahead of time to notify them and prepare them for such a change.",
Downloading the content is very difficult and makes you accidentally open the movie do a download press like Netflix away from opening,
When I update program in it does not support my android tv box... Please solve this problem,
"After doing update on doesn't respond It crashes, lags",
"TEVII 500 Android box is not accepting the application after the last update , why ? Can you please support to solve",
